## Project Management
Motivator was created over a period of seven days following a simplified Agile development process. The team met for "sit-down stand-ups" at least three times a day: morning, after lunch, and close-of-day. We initially tracked our tasks on a Trello board, but without a formal Agile scrum master to maintain the Trello board, it was quickly replaced by the whiteboard that we updated during each stand-up. With all three team members working within fifteen feet of the whiteboard all day every day, this system kept everyone up to date without losing development time to updating a Trello board after each stand-up.

Now that our formal time at DBC is completed, and work on the project will be performed remotely, we will go back to the Trello board to manage further development.
